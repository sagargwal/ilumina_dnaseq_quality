# FasterQC: Analyzing the Quality of Illumina Sequenced Reads

## Overview

FasterQC is a Python library designed for a comprehensive analysis of the quality of Illumina sequenced reads. As sequencing plays an essential role in various applications, ensuring the reliability and quality of the sequenced data becomes paramount. This library provides functionalities to delve deep into various quality metrics, ensuring the generation of reliable sequencing data.

## Features

FasterQC offers several functionalities to cater to different quality analysis needs:

### 1. `betterqc`

- **Functionality**: Analyzes base per sequence quality, offering insights into the quality distribution across sequences.

### 2. `betterqc_zoom`

- **Functionality**: Allows users to zoom into specific ranges within the sequences, providing a more granular view of quality metrics.

### 3. `quality_distribution`

- **Functionality**: Offers insights into the mean quality distribution of reads, providing an overall idea about quality parameters.

### 4. `per_base_pos`

- **Functionality**: Analyzes the per base sequence content at each position of the reads, offering a detailed breakdown of the sequencing content.
